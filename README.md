# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
After our initial analysis of the grades among the different school districts, it came to light that there may be potential dishonesty from the 9th graders at Thomas High School. In reaction to this, and in order to uphold state testing standards, we have removed those grades from consideration and re-ran our analysis without them.

## Results
Here, we will take a step back to see how the refactoring of the results by removing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School impacts the resutls.

The difference between the district schools results for math is negligible, however we do see a significant drop in the reading scores

We see here that the overall passing rate for Thomas High School was 90.95% however after we refactored out analsis, the passing rate dropped to 90.63%. This is not a huge drop, however it is definitely something we want to take note of.

In both scenarios, Thomas High School is the second place school, therefore we did not see a drastic change in performance placement after updating the scores.
